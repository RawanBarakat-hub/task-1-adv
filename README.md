Library Management System
This project is a Library Management System that allows developers to manage core book operations such as adding and deleting books.
The user interface displays books as cards, each containing:
 1-Book Title
 2-Author Name
 3-Category
 4-Availability Status with a button to toggle availability
Users can:
1-Search for books by title or author
2- Filter books by category
3-Changeavailability
From an object-oriented programming perspective, the system implements:
1-Encapsulation on class attributes
2-Polymorphism in subclasses
3-Proper use of Abstraction for clean and maintainable design
